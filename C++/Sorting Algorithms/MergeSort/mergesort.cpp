// Merge sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two parts of a
// sublist. It sorts each sublist and then merges them. To sort each sublist, the algorithm
// divides the sublist in two again. If this sublist of the sublist can be divided into two halves,
// then it will be. The idea of the merge sort is that it will merge all the sorted sublists into the
// fully sorted list.
